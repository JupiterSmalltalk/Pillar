I am an abstract class to describe a Phase of an export. 
A Phase take an input, transform it and return an output.

configuration is the configuration of the export.

To create a new phase you have to define his prority as a class method then to define the action of the Phase with a method 'actionOn: anInput'. This method will return an output. 
You can also add some transformations to the output like: 

	transformerInputFileOn: aCollection
	<pillarTransformer: 1> "the parameter is the priority of the transformation"
	aCollection
		do: [ :each | 
			PRFileInclusion new
				configuration: self configuration;
				start: each ]
